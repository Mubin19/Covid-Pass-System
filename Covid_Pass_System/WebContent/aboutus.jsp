<p>
In Covid pass system, the system will provide a pass to the people who wanted travel to any public place like theaters, malls etc. So, the system will provide a pass for fully vaccinated people, so they can travel to public places by showing the covid pass.
	The system will include authorized Hospitals from where you can do the RTPCR test. When the person will apply for the pass, after the RTPCR test if the report is negative   the person will get the pass (green). If the RTPCR test is positive the application will get cancelled.
	The green pass will have validity up to 30 days, after the 30 days the pass will convert to orange pass till 5 days. After that the pass will expire and it will red pass. For renewing the pass the person will again do the RTPCR from our authorized Hospital the again same for positive and negative report.
	The report will be generated from the Authorized Hospital the hospital will update the report to system then system will generate the pass and provide to customers within 24-36 hours.
